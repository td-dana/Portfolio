    <p>When I first moved to the U.S., I did not know a single word of English.
    I had to go to ELD classes in school to learn English for two years.
    I finally transferred to a regular class in fifth grade after two years of learning English.
    As a child, I moved schools often; I attended three different elementary schools and a different middle school from the one I was supposed to go to.
    All of our family are first generation immigrants so they worked really hard to even just provide our family a regular life.
    I'm always grateful for everything I have.  :)
